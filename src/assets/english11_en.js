Well, actually four languages.
Meysam

Four! Really?! What languages do you know?
Mr. Saberian

Besides  my  mother  tongue,  Persian,  I  know  English,  
French  and  Russian  well.
Meysam

Interesting! And when did you learn them?
Mr. Saberian

I began learning English at school when I was thirteen. 
Then  I  began  learning  French  in  a  language  institute

Language  is  a  system  of  communication.  It  uses  written  and  spoken  
forms. People use language to communicate with each other in a society. 
They exchange knowledge, beliefs, wishes, and feelings through it. 
Languages vary greatly from region to region. They are so different 
that  a  person  may  not  understand  the  language  of  someone  from  
another  region,  country  or  continent.  It  is  not  surprising  to  hear  that  
today about 7000 languages exist in the world. There are more than 
2000  languages  in  Africa,  1000  in  the  Americas,  more  than  2250  in  
Asia,  about  230  in  Europe,  and  more  than  1300  in  Oceania.  
Native  speakers  of  these  languages  range  in  number  from  very  
large, with hundreds of millions of speakers, to very small, with fewer 
than 10 speakers. The most popular language in the world is Chinese. 
More  than  one  billion  people  in  the  world  speak  Chinese.  
Languages of the World
LESSON

LESSON

25
Interestingly, English has fewer native speakers than Chinese, but there 
are  about  one  billion  learners  of  English  all  around  the  world.  They  
learn  English  as  an  international  language.
About fifty percent of the world’s languages have fewer than 5000 
speakers. In the beginning of the twenty-first century, 204 languages 
had  fewer  than  10  speakers  and  344  languages  had  between  10  and  
99 speakers. The 548 languages with fewer than 99 speakers make up 
nearly 8 percent of the world’s languages. We call them ‘endangered 
languages’. As the speakers of such languages grow old and die, their 
languages will die, too.   
All  languages  are  really  valuable,  despite  their  differences.  Every  
language is an amazing means of communication that meets the needs 
of  its  own  speakers.  It  is  impossible  to  imagine  the  world  without  
language. Therefore, we should respect all languages, no matter how 
different they are and how many speakers they have.
You  can  scan  a  reading  passage  to  look  for  and  find  specific 
information quickly such as a number, a name, a word, or a phrase.
Follow these steps to scan:
  Make  a  clear  picture  in  your  mind  of  the  information  you  
are  looking  for.
 Look for that information.

A
. Read the following texts. 
An  endangered  language  is  
a  language
  that  has  very  
few  speakers
. 
Nowadays, 
many languages
 are losing their native speakers. When a 
language dies, the knowledge and culture disappear with it. 
A lot of 
endangered languages
 are in Australia and South America. Some of 
them are in Asia and Africa. The number of live languages of the world 
is around 7000, and many of them may not exist in the future. 
Many 
researchers
 are now trying to protect endangered languages. This can 
save 
lots of information
 and cultural values of people all around the 
world.          
There are many uncountable words for food in English. Native speakers 
often
use
words
such
as
‘a
bag
of,
‘two
slices
of’,
or
‘a
piece
of’
with
uncountable nouns. This usually happens 
when they go shopping. They 
may ask for 
two bottles
of
 water, 
a bag of 
sugar, 
a loaf of 
bread, or 
two kilos of
 meat. In a coffee shop, they may order 
a cup of
 tea, 
a piece 
of
 cake, or 
a glass
 of juice. If a foreign learner uses uncountable words 
wrongly, English speakers may not understand them well. So when you 
learn English, be very careful about this important point.

              Simple Sentences
In English, every simple sentence must have at least a subject and a 
verb. Such a sentence is called a ‘simple sentence’. 
Who or what the 
sentence  speaks  about  is  called  the  
subject
.  What  the  sentence  says  
about  the  subject  is  called  the  
verb
.  In  the  following  sentences,  the  
subject  is  underlined  once  and  the  verb  twice.
Mahan is sleeping.
LESSON

38
The bird does not sing.
The apple fell down.
The teacher is hard-working.
LESSON
1
39
1) To find a subject, ask who or what the sentence is about. Your answer 
is the subject.
2) To find a verb, ask what the sentence says about the subject. 
Who is the first sentence about?  
Mahan
What is the second sentence about? 
The bird
What is the third sentence about? 
The apple
Who is the fourth sentence about? 
The teacher
What does the first sentence say about Mahan?  
Mahan is 
sleeping.
What does the second sentence say about the bird? 
The bird does 
not sing.
What does the third sentence say about the apple? 
The apple
fell 
down. 
What does the fourth sentence say about the teacher? 
The teacher 
is hard-working.
Remember  that  the  ‘subject’  of  a  sentence  is  a  ‘noun’  (any  person,  
place, or thing) or a pronoun. A 
pronoun
 is simply a word like I, we, 
he, she, it, you, or they used in place of a noun.
As  you  see,  a  sentence  begins  with  a  capital  letter  and  ends  with  a  
period.

Have you ever thought of a healthy lifestyle to live longer? People can 
do many things to have a healthier life. Most people have a special diet 
or do lots of exercise; however, without a careful plan they may hurt 
themselves. 
To have a healthier lifestyle, people need to do certain things. First 
they should check their general health. Measuring blood pressure and 
heartbeat is the most important thing to do. They also need to check 
their family health history. In this way, they understand if anyone in 
the family has had a special illness. 
Another thing is paying attention to physical health. For example, 
eating    healthy    food    helps    
people    live    longer    and    
prevents    diseases.    Eating    
junk  food  makes  people  gain  
weight,  and  increases  the  risk  of  
heart attack. Eating balanced servings 
of bread, vegetables, fruits, protein, and oil 
is necessary for everyone. Also, daily exercises 
improve   people’s   health   condition.   
An effective way to enjoy a better lifestyle 
is  having  healthy  relationships  with  others.  
Recent research has shown that a good social 
life  decreases  the  risk  of  death.  Sadly,  some  
people  do  not  visit  their  relatives  very  
often these days. They are really busy 
with  their  work  and  usually  use  
technology  to  communicate.

Bad  habits  and  addiction  can  be  harmful  to  health.  One  day  of  
smoking  can  take  around  5  hours  away  from  the  smoker’s  life.  
Addiction  to  technology  such  as  using  computers  for  a  long  time  is  
also  dangerous.  
Above all, the most important thing to enjoy a good life is having 
emotional  health.  Praying  decreases  stress  and  gives  people  a  calm  
and  balanced  life.  People  with  this  lifestyle  have  had  a  better  life.      
There  are  many  other  things  people  can  do  to  live  healthier  and  
longer. The key point, however, is having a plan for the way they want 
to live and take care of their physical and emotional health.

A gerund is a 
verb + -ing
 that works like a noun. A gerund can be a 
subject  or  an  object  in  a  sentence.  
Swimming
 is useful for everyone.
Reading
 helps us learn English.
A gerund is always singular. When one gerund is the subject of a sen-
tence, it takes a singular verb.
 Walking 
makes
 me happy. 
But when two gerunds form the subject, the verb is plural.
 Cycling and jogging 
are
 my favorite sports.
Sometimes a noun follows a gerund:
Playing
football
 was his fun.
Taking
photos
 is her hobby.
Learning
a language
 takes time.
Cycling
 is good exercise.

Why is too much

dangerous?
 People’s busy lifestyle in big cities has created many problems for their health.
 Rushing  to  and  from  school  and  work  has  made  it  hard  for  everyone  to  be
 physically active. Many people do not have time to cook or prepare healthy food.
 They eat unhealthy snacks and junk food. This type of diet has changed people’s
 taste and many young people now prefer fast food to homemade dishes. Watching
 TV and working with technology for long hours have also risked people’s health.
 They have increased the risk of heart diseases and sleep disorders. So the things
that seem so simple now can cause serious problems in the future.

Art  is  what  people  create  with  imagination  and  skill.  As  a  part  of  
culture, it shows the way of life and identity of a nation and reflects 
the history of a society. In fact, the history of humankind is the history 
of art. If we want to know a country or a nation well, we should study 
its art.
Handicrafts are good examples of the art and culture of a country. 
By  handicrafts,  we  mean    making  decorative  items  in  a  skillful  way  
using our hands. Each country and culture has its own handicrafts.
Making and selling handicrafts are good ways to help a country’s 
economy  and  introduce  its  culture  to  other  nations.  Many  people  of  
the world produce handicrafts and sell them to tourists. In some Asian 
countries  a  part  of  the  country’s  income  comes  from  making  and  
selling  handicrafts.
Iran  has  a  five-thousand-year-old  history  of  artistic  works  and 
handicrafts including pottery, painting, calligraphy, rugs and carpets, 
etc. If you travel across 
Iran,   you’ll   get   back   
home   with   excellent 
handicrafts  as  souvenirs  
for your family and friends.

Iranian art is also quite famous all around the world. There are very 
excellent  collections  of  Persian  art  in  many  important  museums  of 
the world. If we want to name countries with richest art and cultural 
diversity, Iran is among them. Persian art is famous in the world for 
reflecting  moral  and  social  values  of  Iranian  people  and  the  natural 
beauty  of  this  vast  country.  
Iranian craftsmen and craftswomen are famous for producing very 
unique artworks from wood, metal and other simple materials around 
them. Many people of the world appreciate the art and skill of a young 
Iranian  girl  who  weaves  a  beautiful  silk  carpet  in  a  small  village  of  
Azarbaijan or Kordestan. When tourists buy Persian rugs or carpets, 
they take a part of Iranian art and culture to their homelands.
We  use  reference  words  instead  of  repeating  the  names  of

Antonyms are words that have opposite meanings. Sometimes antonyms 
are very different words, for example ‘true’ and ‘false
’
 or ‘hot

Other times, they are made by adding or changing prefixes or suffixes, 
for  example,  ‘like
’
  and  ‘dislike

are you really interested in art? 
If
 you enjoy art, you will 
become a good artist. Most people like art, but some do not 
understand it. 
If
 you do not see any special thing in a pottery, 
you
won’t
appreciate
its
value.
If
 you do not appreciate the 
value 
of art, you cannot become a successful artist. You will

An infinitive is the ‘to’ form of  a verb, for instance, the infinitive form 
of ‘study’ is ‘

You can use an infinitive as the subject of a sentence:

But its gerund form is more natural: 
Smoking

 Art can improve people’s physical, mental, and emotional wellness. If people
 use their art skills in a right way, they will be able to communicate their feelings.
 They will understand their family and friends better. Art can help people have
 better relationship with each other. The power of art decreases the risk of many
 illnesses such as heart attack. If people practice art, they will get along with their
 stress and enjoy the pleasure of making artwork. You can try this by drawing
simple things or making simple objects. You will see its power!
