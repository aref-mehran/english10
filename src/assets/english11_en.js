Language is a system of communication. It uses written and spoken
forms. People use language to communicate with each other in a society.
They exchange knowledge, beliefs, wishes, and feelings through it.
Languages vary greatly from region to region. They are so different
that a person may not understand the language of someone from
another region, country or continent. It is not surprising to hear that
today about 7000 languages exist in the world. There are more than
2000 languages in Africa, 1000 in the Americas, more than 2250 in
Asia, about 230 in Europe, and more than 1300 in Oceania.
Native speakers of these languages range in number from very
large, with hundreds of millions of speakers, to very small, with fewer
than 10 speakers. The most popular language in the world is Chinese.
More than one billion people in the world speak Chinese.

Interestingly, English has fewer native speakers than Chinese, but there
are about one billion learners of English all around the world. They
learn English as an international language.
About fifty percent of the world’s languages have fewer than 5000
speakers. In the beginning of the twenty-first century, 204 languages
had fewer than 10 speakers and 344 languages had between 10 and
99 speakers. The 548 languages with fewer than 99 speakers make up
nearly 8 percent of the world’s languages. We call them ‘endangered
languages’. As the speakers of such languages grow old and die, their
languages will die, too.
All languages are really valuable, despite their differences. Every
language is an amazing means of communication that meets the needs
of its own speakers. It is impossible to imagine the world without
language. Therefore, we should respect all languages, no matter how
different they are and how many speakers they have.
You can scan a reading passage to look for and find specific
information quickly such as a number, a name, a word, or a phrase.
Follow these steps to scan:
Make a clear picture in your mind of the information you
are looking for.
Look for that information.
Move your eyes quickly across the text. Don’t read every
word. When you find the information, stop, read the
sentence and mark the information.

A. Read the following texts.
An endangered language is a language that has very few speakers.
Nowadays, many languages are losing their native speakers. When a
language dies, the knowledge and culture disappear with it. A lot of
endangered languages are in Australia and South America. Some of
them are in Asia and Africa. The number of live languages of the world
is around 7000, and many of them may not exist in the future. Many
researchers are now trying to protect endangered languages. This can
save lots of information and cultural values of people all around the
world.
There are many uncountable words for food in English. Native speakers
often use words such as ‘a bag of, ‘two slices of’, or ‘a piece of’ with
uncountable nouns. This usually happens when they go shopping. They
may ask for two bottles of water, a bag of sugar, a loaf of bread, or
two kilos of meat. In a coffee shop, they may order a cup of tea, a piece
of cake, or a glass of juice. If a foreign learner uses uncountable words
wrongly, English speakers may not understand them well. So when you
learn English, be very careful about this important point.

Simple Sentences
In English, every simple sentence must have at least a subject and a
verb. Such a sentence is called a ‘simple sentence’. Who or what the
sentence speaks about is called the subject. What the sentence says
about the subject is called the verb. In the following sentences, the
subject is underlined once and the verb twice.
Mahan is sleeping.
L E S S O N

The bird does not sing.
The apple fell down.
The teacher is hard-working.
L E S S O N

1) To find a subject, ask who or what the sentence is about. Your answer
is the subject.
2) To find a verb, ask what the sentence says about the subject.
Who is the first sentence about? Mahan
What is the second sentence about? The bird
What is the third sentence about? The apple
Who is the fourth sentence about? The teacher
What does the first sentence say about Mahan? Mahan is
sleeping.
What does the second sentence say about the bird? The bird does
not sing.
What does the third sentence say about the apple? The apple
fell down.
What does the fourth sentence say about the teacher? The teacher
is hard-working.
Remember that the ‘subject’ of a sentence is a ‘noun’ (any person,
place, or thing) or a pronoun. A pronoun is simply a word like I, we,
he, she, it, you, or they used in place of a noun.
As you see, a sentence begins with a capital letter and ends with a
period.

Have you ever thought of a healthy lifestyle to live longer? People can
do many things to have a healthier life. Most people have a special diet
or do lots of exercise; however, without a careful plan they may hurt
themselves.
To have a healthier lifestyle, people need to do certain things. First
they should check their general health. Measuring blood pressure and
heartbeat is the most important thing to do. They also need to check
their family health history. In this way, they understand if anyone in
the family has had a special illness.
Another thing is paying attention to physical health. For example,
eating healthy food helps
people live longer and
prevents diseases. Eating
junk food makes people gain
weight, and increases the risk of
heart attack. Eating balanced servings
of bread, vegetables, fruits, protein, and oil
is necessary for everyone. Also, daily exercises
improve people’s health condition.
An effective way to enjoy a better lifestyle
is having healthy relationships with others.
Recent research has shown that a good social
life decreases the risk of death. Sadly, some
people do not visit their relatives very
often these days. They are really busy
with their work and usually use
technology to communicate.

Bad habits and addiction can be harmful to health. One day of
smoking can take around 5 hours away from the smoker’s life.
Addiction to technology such as using computers for a long time is
also dangerous.
Above all, the most important thing to enjoy a good life is having
emotional health. Praying decreases stress and gives people a calm
and balanced life. People with this lifestyle have had a better life.
There are many other things people can do to live healthier and
longer. The key point, however, is having a plan for the way they want
to live and take care of their physical and emotional health.

Technology has influenced the lives of people in this century. Working

lifestyles. Some people use their laptops and especially their mobile
phones everywhere for no good reason. Some of them have not read a
book for months. Some have not visited their relatives for a long time.
Some even have not slept well or have not eaten properly for a long time.
Some of these people have quit good habits like doing daily exercises or
attending social events. They have chosen an unhealthy lifestyle. To live
longer, they need to rethink the way they live, work, and use technology.
Technology has helped the researchers and scientists of our time. New
medicines and medical inventions have saved the lives of many people.
They have let people have a happy life and live longer. New medicines
such as anti-cancer drugs and new antibiotics have cured many patients.
Some technological inventions have helped doctors to check people’s
health condition. They have found keys to the secrets of the human
body. New technologies have helped doctors to understand how diseases
develop. They have found ways to fight and stop diseases in their early

People’s busy lifestyle in big cities has created many problems for their health.
Rushing to and from school and work has made it hard for everyone to be
physically active. Many people do not have time to cook or prepare healthy food.
They eat unhealthy snacks and junk food. This type of diet has changed people’s
taste and many young people now prefer fast food to homemade dishes. Watching
TV and working with technology for long hours have also risked people’s health.
They have increased the risk of heart diseases and sleep disorders. So the things

Antonyms are words that have opposite meanings. Sometimes antonyms
are very different words, for example ‘true’ and ‘false’ or ‘hot’ and ‘cold’.
Other times, they are made by adding or changing prefixes or suffixes,
for example, ‘like’ and ‘dislike’ or ‘careful’ and ‘careless’. Learning
antonyms is a good way to develop our vocabulary.

A. Read the following text.
Our neighbor is a craftsman. I love his beautiful artworks.
Whenever I see his works, I say to myself, “when I grow up,
I will become an artist like him”. One day he told me: “Amir,
are you really interested in art? If you enjoy art, you will
become a good artist. Most people like art, but some do not
understand it. If you do not see any special thing in a pottery,
you won’t appreciate its value. If you do not appreciate the
value of art, you cannot become a successful artist. You will
just make things. If you really like art, you will need two
things in the future: education and experience. Study hard,
work hard, and create things to make people happy.”

of ‘study’ is ‘to study’.

Smoking is very bad for everyone.
We can also use infinitives as an object of a sentence.

better relationship with each other. The power of art decreases the risk of many
