و دبيران گرامی می توانند با مراجعه به راهنمای معلم اين پايه با فرايند دقيق آن آشنا شوند.
همچون گذشته به دبيران گرامی توصيه می شود در اين كتاب نيز روند آموزش خود را منطبق با شيوه

در خاتمه مجدّداً يادآور می شود كه بستهٔ آموزشی حاضر نيز با حاكميت رويكرد ارتباطی فعال و
خودباورانه، جنبه های متنوع نيازهای آموزشی دانش آموزان را در نظر داشته و در كنار كتاب دانش آموز
با ارائهٔ كتاب كار، كتاب راهنمای معلم، کتاب گویا )فایل صوتی( و فلش كارت آموزشی مخصوص دبيران
و همچنين لوح فشردهٔ آموزش معلمان )برفراز آسمان(، مجموعه كاملی را در اختيار فراگيران قرار داده
است، لذا معرفی و استفاده از كتاب ها و بسته های كمک آموزشی موازی كه درطرح سامان بخشی کتاب های
کمک آموزشی دفتر فنّاوری و انتشارات کمک آموزشی سازمان پژوهش و برنامه ریزی آموزشی به تصویب
نرسیده اند و در اكثر موارد انطباق چندانی با برنامه درسی ملی و اهداف بستهٔ آموزشی حاضر ندارند،
هيچ گونه ضرورتی ندارد.
بی شک تحقق اهداف مورد نظر اين بستهٔ آموزشی نيازمند حمايت های همه جانبه و ارزشمند همكاران
گرامی است كه در سراسر ايران اسلامی با دلسوزی و تلاش فراوان، زمينهٔ رشد و بالندگی آينده سازان ميهن
عزيزمان را فراهم می آورند، مؤلفان، اين تلاش ارزشمند را ارج نهاده و آرزومند اعتلای روزافزون نام مقدس
