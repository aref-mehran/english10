Mohammad Gharib?
Sara:
I guess I have only seen his name in my English book, 
but  I’m  not  
sure  about  it.
Nurse:
Dr. Gharib was a famous physician. 
Sara:
Oh,... can you tell me a little about his life?
Nurse:
Dr. Gharib was born in Tehran in 1288. After receiving 
his  diploma,  he  went  abroad  to  study  medicine.  In  
1316  he  became  a  physician  and  then  came  back  to  
his homeland. 
In 1347 this center was founded by Dr. 
Gharib  and  one  of  his  close  friends.

Really? I didn’t know that.

Dr. Gharib was also a generous man. He spared no pains

On  a  spring  morning,  an  old  woman  was  sitting  on  the  sofa  in  her  
house. Her young son was reading a newspaper. Suddenly a pigeon sat 
on  the  window.  
The mother asked her son quietly, “What is this?” The son replied: 
“It is a pigeon”. After a few minutes, she asked her son for the second 
time, “What is this?” The son said, “Mom, I have just told you, “It is a 
pigeon, a pigeon”. After a little while, the old mother asked her son for 
the third time, “What is this?” This time the son shouted at his mother, 
“Why do you keep asking me the same question again and again? Are 
you hard of hearing?”
A little later, the mother went to her room and came back with an 
old diary. She said, “My dear son, I bought this diary when you were 
born”. Then, she opened a page and kindly asked her son to read 
that  page.  The  son  looked  at  the  page,  paused  and  
started  reading  it  aloud:  
Respect your Parents
LESSON

Today my little son 
was sitting on my lap, 
when a pigeon sat on 
the  window.  My  son  
asked me what it was 
15 times, and I replied 
to  him  all  15  times  
that  it  was  a  pigeon.  
I  hugged  him  lovingly  
each  time  when  he  
asked me the same 
question  again  and  
again.  I  did  not  
feel angry at all. I 
was  actually  feeling  
happy for my lovely 
child.
Suddenly the son burst into tears, hugged his old mother and said 
repeatedly,  “Mom,  mom,  forgive  me;  please  forgive  me.”  The  old  
woman  hugged  her  son,  kissed  him  and  said  calmly,  “We  must  care  
for those who once cared for us. We all know how parents cared for 
their children for every little thing. Children must love them, respect 
them,  and  care  for  them”.
Question   generation   is   a   reading   comprehension   strategy   
whereby  readers  ask  and  answer  meaningful  questions  about  
the important points or main ideas of a text. Using this strategy, 
students  ask  and  answer  their  own  questions  rather  than  only  
answering  questions  provided  by  the  book  or  the  teacher.
Follow these steps:
1. Read the text.
2

Collocations
A collocation is two or more words that often go together. Collocations 
tell  us  which  words  can  come  before  or  after  other  words.  These  
combinations just sound ‛right’ to native speakers, who use them all the 
time. On the other hand, other combinations may be unnatural and just 
sound  ‛wrong’.

 identity of our past and the responsibility to protect it for our future generations.
 What I can add at the end is the role of our parents’ morals, values, and principles
 in our lives. Our elders have either learned, created or have been brought up with
 a set of morals, values and principles in their lives. Our elders want the best for
 us and they are willing to tell us what set of rules and guidelines have made them
successful, and hopefully, peaceful.

A  good  dictionary  gives  the  user  information  about  words  such  as  
spellings, pronunciations and definitions. It also gives examples of 
how to use the words in sentences correctly. Therefore, it is essential 
to know how to use a dictionary. In this lesson, we provide you with 
some  helpful  tips  on  how  to  use  a  dictionary  effectively.
1.  Choose  the  Right  Dictionary
.  There  are  many  different  types  of  
dictionaries such as learner’s dictionaries, general dictionaries, picture 
dictionaries, etc. Therefore, first identify your needs. Without choosing 
the right one you cannot meet your language needs.
2.  Read  the  Introduction
.  The  best  way  to  learn  how  to  use  your  
dictionary effectively is to read its introduction. This section explains 
issues  like  how  entries  are  arranged,  what  information  is  offered  in  
entries  and  what  abbreviations  and  pronunciation  symbols  are  used  
throughout  the  entries.
3.  Learn  the  Abbreviations
.  Different  types  of  abbreviations  are  
often used in the definitions for a word. This can 
be  confusing  if  you  do  not  know  what  the  
abbreviations  stand  for.
How to Use a Dictionary

52
LESSON
2
53
4. Learn the Guide to Pronunciation
. If you immediately jump into 
using the dictionary without understanding the pronunciation guide, it 
can be difficult to figure it out.
5. Read the Guide Words
. These are the two words at the top of each 
page that show the first and last entries on the page. These words will 
help you find the word you are looking for in the right letter section.
6. Read the Definitions
. Once you find an entry, you can find the exact 
meaning  of  the  word,  its  pronunciation,  part  of  speech,  synonyms,  
antonyms, and probably its origin.
7. Look for Collocations
. Learning the meaning of a single word is 
not usually enough. Through sentence examples, try to learn ‘words in 
combination’ to expand your vocabulary.
One way to remember what you have read is to highlight 
important information. Use these guidelines for highlighting 
a text:
-
Highlight
the
main
ideas.
-
Highlight
the
key
points
not
minor
details
or
less
important
information.
-
Highlight
phrases
and
parts
of
sentences
instead
of
entire
sentences.
-
Do
not
highlight
many
sentences
or
too
much
of
the
text.

B
.  Now  go  back  to  the  ‘
Reading’
.  It  claims  that  you  can  be  familiar  
with useful information to use a dictionary more effectively. Highlight 
parts  of  the  passage  that  support  this  claim.
C
. Read the ‘Reading’. Generate questions with the following question 
starters and then answer them.
LESSON

55
Word Part Families
One way to figure out the meaning of an unknown word is to look 
for its relationship with other words in the same family. Even 
if you cannot figure out the exact meaning, your understanding 
can  be  enough  to  allow  you  to  read  on.  For  example,  
in  this  
sentence
: 
“We provide you with some helpful information on how to use 
a dictionary more effectively”
you can get an idea of the meaning of the word 
effectively
 by 
recognizing that it is related to the word 
effect
.
In this technique which is also known as 
word attack
, looking 
for word parts can help you read and understand the meaning of 
complicated words. When you recognize prefixes and suffixes 
and know what they mean, it will help you work out the meaning 
of many words you read. 
LESSON
2
56
B
. Attack these words to figure out their meanings. Try to write down 
other  words  related  to  them.  For  example:  
disconnection
:
disconnect/
connection/
connect
 unsystematically:  
 incomprehensible:
 unexpectedly: 
 international:  
 unchangeable: 
A
. Look at the following sentences. Write down at least one other word 
you know that is related to the bold word.

                                            Paragraph
What is a paragraph?
A paragraph is a group of sentences about one idea. A paragraph can 
(1) give us information, (2) tell us an opinion, (3) explain something 
to us, or (4) tell us a short story. Every sentence in a paragraph is about 
the same idea. When you want to write about a new idea, begin a new 
paragraph.
Paragraph format
Paragraphs  have  a  special  shape.  In  each  paragraph,  the  sentences  
are  grouped  together.  They  come  one  after  another.  Remember  that  
sentences  in  a  paragraph  start  with  a  capital  letter  and  end  with  a  
period  (.),  question  mark  (?)  or  exclamation  point  (!).

Oceans and Lakes
Oceans and lakes have much in common, but they are also quite different.
Both  are  bodies  of  water,  but  oceans  are  very  large  bodies  of  salt  
water,  while  lakes  are  much  smaller  bodies  of  fresh  water.  
Lakes  are  usually  surrounded  by  land,  while  oceans  are  what  
surround     continents.     
Both have plants and animals living in them. 
The  ocean  is  home  to  the  largest  animals  on  the  planet,  whereas  
lakes  support  much  smaller  forms  of  life.

. Look at the topic sentences from paragraphs you have seen in Vision 2. 
Find the topic and the controlling idea.
1) Language is a system of communication.
2) About fifty percent of the world’s languages have fewer than 5000 
speakers.
3) Bad habits and addiction can be harmful to health.
4) Art is what people create with imagination and skill.
5) Handicrafts are good examples of the art and culture of a country
.
For example:
Topic sentence 1

      controlling idea
Topic sentence 2: 
A cheetah is a wild animal from the cat family.
 topic                controlling idea
The most important sentence in a paragraph is the
،
topic sentence’. 
It is called the 
،
topic sentence’ because it tells readers what they are 
going to read about.
A topic sentence has two parts:
1. A topic: what the paragraph is about,
2. A controlling idea: what the writer is going to focus on it in the 
paragraph.
LESSON
2
66
Read the following paragraphs. First find the topic sentence, 
then circle the topic, and underline the controlling idea.
1. Ants are found everywhere in the world. They make their home 
in  buildings,  gardens,  etc.  They  live  in  anthills. Ants  are  very 
hardworking insects. Throughout the summers they collect food for 
the winter season. Whenever they find a sweet on the floor, they 
stick to the sweet and carry it to their home. Thus, in this way, they 
clean the floor. Ants are generally red and black in colour. They 
have two eyes and six legs. They are social insects. 
2. The stars are tiny points of light in the space. On a clear night we 
can see around 2,000 to 3,000 stars without using a telescope. Stars 
look tiny in the sky because they are far away from the Earth. In 
ancient times the sky watchers found patterns of stars in the sky. 
The topic sentence is usually the first or sometimes the last sentence, 
but it can be any sentence in the paragraph.

3. An online dictionary is one that is available on the Internet or World 
Wide Web and is accessed through a Web browser using a computer 
or a mobile device, primarily by typing a term into a search box on 
the site. Online dictionaries offer immediate, direct access through 
large  databases  to  a  word’s  spelling  and  meanings,  plus  a  host  of  
information, including its spellings, pronunciation, and origin, etc.
4. A hearing device is available for some people suffering from hearing 
loss. This device uses a magnet. Like other aids, it converts sounds 
into vibrations and transmits them directly to the magnet, and then 
to the inner ear, producing a clearer sound. The device helps those 
with  a  hearing  loss  caused  by  infection  or  other  problems  in  the  
middle ear.

I know electricity can be produced from water and 
sunlight. How might it be generated from wind? 
Father

Well, a wind turbine works the opposite of a fan. Instead 
of using electricity to make wind, a turbine 
uses wind 
to  make  electricity.  It  is  a  type  of  clean  energy.

Energy  is  the  ability  to  do  work.  It  can  take  a  variety  of  forms:  
mechanical, electrical, chemical, and nuclear. To produce any type of 
energy, the resources of the earth are used. The main resources of the 
earth  are  fossil  fuels  such  as  natural  gas,  oil,  and  coal.  
We get most of our energy from these fossil fuels, but this is harmful to 
the environment. Fossil fuels are nonrenewable and cannot be replaced 
easily. Once we use them up, they’re gone forever. They are not clean 
as they pollute water or air. 
In recent years, scientists try to use other types of energy resources. 
They call them clean energy resources because they do not pollute the 
earth. Clean energy is renewable. It is made from resources that can be 
replaced, like wind, water, sunshine, tides, and plants. When renewable 
energy resources are used, the demand for fossil fuels is reduced.
The  most  common  type  of  clean  energy  is  the  solar  power.  Solar  
energy  is  produced  by  the  radiation  that  reaches  the  earth.  People  
have used the sun as a heat source for thousands of years. Iranians, for 
instance, use special designs and arrangements of windows, balconies 
and yards to get the most sunshine. Different types of materials might 
also  be  used  in  building  the  houses.  This  keeps  people  warm  during  
cold  seasons  and  cool  during  hot  days  of  the  year.  
Nowadays, solar energy can be converted into other forms of energy, 
such as heat and electricity. Solar energy might be used 
for  heating  water  and  air  in  homes,  
Earth for our Children
buildings, or swimming pools. Maybe you’ve seen buildings or houses 
with  big  shiny  panels  on  the  roof.  These  are  solar  collectors  that  
collect  heat  by  absorbing  sunlight  and  producing  solar  power.  Also,  
solar energy can be used in generating electricity to provide power for 
watches,  highway  signs,  houses  and  even  space  stations.
Clean  energy  resources  are  widely  used  in  many  countries  to  keep  
cities and villages clean. As a result, fewer fossil fuels are consumed 
each  year  and  they  are  saved  for  the  future  generations.  
Learning to take good notes is very important. Good notes can help 
you remember and review a text you have read. There is no magic 
formula to taking notes when reading.You have to find out what 
works best for you. However, the following guidelines are suggested:
Be
sure
to
include
all
the
important
ideas
and
examples.
Write
only
important
words,
not
complete
sentences.
Use
abbreviations
and
symbols.
You can write your notes in the margins or on a separate page.For 
example, the notes of the following paragraph were taken as follows:

Proverbs
A proverb is a short well-known sentence that gives practical advice 
about  life.  Proverbs  surround  us  every  day.  Whether  at  home,  work,  
school, or during a conversation with a friend, the likelihood of hearing 
a  proverb  is  high.  For  example,  the  following  common  proverbs  in  
English have common equivalents in Persian.
God helps those who
help themselves
The early bird
